# Iris_flower_classification
Classification is a supervised machine learning technique which is used to predict group membership for data instances. 
Neural networks are being introduced to simplify the
problem of classification.
Classification of iris flowers is perhaps the best-known example of machine learning.

The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements.

The iris data set contains fifty instances of each of the three species.

The central goal is to design a model that makes proper classifications for new flowers. In other words, one which exhibits good generalization.

The first step is to prepare the data set. This is the source of information for the classification problem. For that, we need to configure the following concepts:

Data source.
Variables.
Instances.
The data source is the file iris_flowers.csv. It contains the data for this example in comma-separated values (CSV) format. The number of columns is 5, and the number of rows is 150.
